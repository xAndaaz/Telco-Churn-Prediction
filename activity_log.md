# Activity Log & Gemini's Thought Process

This file logs the steps taken to improve the churn prediction model, the reasoning behind those steps, and the outcomes.

## 2025-07-14

### Initial Analysis & Planning

1.  **Project Review:** Accessed and analyzed the core Python files (`data_processing.py`, `train_model.py`, `prediction_pipeline.py`, `retention_strategy.py`, `api/main.py`, etc.).
2.  **Assessment:**
    *   **Strengths:** Solid foundation with XGBoost, Optuna, SHAP, and a modular structure including a FastAPI.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Feature engineering could be more advanced, model evaluation is static, retention strategies are rule-based, and the project lacks robust MLOps practices (config management, testing, experiment tracking).
3.  **Proposed Improvement Plan:**
    *   Enhance feature engineering in `train_model.py`.
    *   Improve model evaluation and activate hyperparameter tuning.
    *   Refine retention strategies to be more data-driven.
    *   Introduce production-readiness features: a `config.yaml`, unit tests, and MLflow integration.

### Execution Log

*   **Next Step (Paused):** Started to implement enhanced feature engineering in `train_model.py`.
*   **User Interruption:** User requested the creation of this activity log to track progress and thinking.
*   **New Instruction:** User requested that all significant changes be committed to Git. I will now commit after each major step.
*   **Current Action:** Updating this log and preparing to check the Git status before proceeding.
