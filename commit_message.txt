fix(pipeline): Correct survival pipeline and optimize API

- Resolved a `ValueError` in the survival analysis pipeline caused by an incorrect function signature call in `data_processing.py`.
- Optimized the FastAPI application by initializing the `shap.TreeExplainer` once at startup, preventing a major performance bottleneck and potential 500 errors.

docs(readme): Update all project documentation

- Overhauled `devReadme.md` to provide a complete and accurate developer's guide, reflecting the latest model architecture (XGBRFClassifier), data flows, and code logic.
- Updated the main `README.md` to be consistent with the new champion model.
- Updated `activity_log.md` to record the latest debugging and documentation tasks.
