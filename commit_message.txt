feat(model): Implement SMOTEENN and improve training script

- Implemented SMOTEENN, a hybrid sampling technique, to address class imbalance more robustly than `scale_pos_weight`.
- The new model trained on resampled data shows a significant increase in precision (0.53 to 0.60), creating a more precise "sharpshooter" model, which has been adopted as the new champion.
- Restored the full training script, correcting a previous error that had removed the benchmarking and Optuna logic.
- Added comments to `train_model.py` to preserve the results of several hyperparameter tuning experiments.
- Added `imbalanced-learn` to the project dependencies.
