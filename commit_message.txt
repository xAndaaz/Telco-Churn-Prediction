feat(model): Tune and select XGBRFClassifier as champion model

- Analyzed initial benchmark results and identified XGBRFClassifier as the best performing baseline model.
- Pivoted strategy to adopt XGBRFClassifier as the new champion, replacing the previous XGBClassifier.
- Implemented and executed a full hyperparameter tuning pipeline for XGBRFClassifier using Optuna.
- Corrected a bug in the Optuna objective function where an unsupported 'early_stopping_rounds' parameter was being passed to the model.
- The newly tuned model shows improved performance and has been saved as the new `model.pkl`.
- Updated `experiments.json` with the latest benchmarking results.
