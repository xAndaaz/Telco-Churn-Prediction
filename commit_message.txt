refactor: Finalize project structure and polish dashboard

This commit concludes the project development with a major refactoring and final UI enhancements.

- **Project Refactoring:**
    - Restructured the entire project into a standard Python package (`churnadvisor`) for improved maintainability and professionalism.
    - Organized all scripts into logical subdirectories (`pipelines`, `training`, `analysis`, `processing`).
    - Updated all imports and file paths to use the new package structure, ensuring robustness with absolute paths.

- **Bug Fix:**
    - Resolved a critical `TypeError` in the `generate_actionable_insight` function.
    - Corrected the function calls in both the batch pipeline and the API to prevent crashes during insight generation.

- **Dashboard Polish:**
    - Added a descriptive text block to the dashboard UI that explicitly highlights the advanced methodologies (XAI, Survival Analysis, CLV) used in the project. This makes the value proposition clear to the end-user.

- **Documentation:**
    - Updated `README.md`, `devReadme.md`, and `activity_log.md` to reflect all the latest changes, including the new project structure and features.
