docs(readme): Update project documentation

- Overhauled the main `README.md` to accurately reflect the current project structure, the unified "Churn Risk Profile" philosophy, and the streamlined user workflow.
- Performed a comprehensive rewrite of `devReadme.md` to serve as a technical guide, detailing the current data flows, core concepts like SMOTEENN and quantile tiering, and the logic of each script.
- Both documents are now aligned with the current, advisory-focused state of the project.
