feat: Enhance dashboard with beeswarm plot and state management

- Replaced the SHAP summary bar plot with a more informative beeswarm plot to show feature impact, distribution, and correlation.
- Resized the plot for a more compact and professional dashboard layout.
- Refactored the entire dashboard application to use Streamlit's session state (`st.session_state`).
- This prevents results from disappearing when the user interacts with other parts of the app, creating a more robust and persistent experience.
- Updated all documentation (README.md, devReadme.md, activity_log.md) to reflect these significant dashboard enhancements.
