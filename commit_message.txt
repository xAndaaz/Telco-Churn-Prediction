fix: Constrain SHAP plot width in dashboard

- Implemented a more robust method to control the SHAP plot's size in the dashboard.
- The plot is now saved to a temporary PNG file and displayed using `st.image` with a fixed width parameter (`width=800`).
- This replaces the previous `st.pyplot` call and prevents the plot from auto-expanding, ensuring a consistent and professional layout.
