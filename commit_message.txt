feat(dashboard): Overhaul and integrate with master pipeline

- Completely overhauled the Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard/app.py`) to align with the new unified Churn Risk Profile pipeline.
- Replaced the multi-button interface with a single, streamlined "Generate Churn Risk Profiles" button for batch processing.
- The dashboard now executes the master pipeline via `subprocess` and displays the final, rich `ActionableInsight` and risk tiers.
- Updated the real-time prediction form to provide advisory insights consistent with the project's new philosophy.
- Refactored `prediction_pipeline.py` and `survival_prediction_pipeline.py` to accept command-line arguments, enabling the dashboard to control them.
