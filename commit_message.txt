feat: Implement final master-detail UI for dashboard results

- Implemented a professional master-detail interface for the batch analysis results to solve the issue of displaying long text insights.
- The UI now features a compact, scrollable `st.dataframe` showing a summary of at-risk customers.
- A `st.selectbox` allows the user to choose a specific customer from the table.
- The full, unabridged `ActionableInsight` for the selected customer is then displayed in a dedicated detail view, clearly labeled with the `customerID`.
- This provides a scalable and highly user-friendly interface that balances a clean overview with accessible, on-demand details.
- Updated all documentation (`activity_log.md`, `devReadme.md`) to reflect this final UI enhancement.
