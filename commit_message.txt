feat(analyzer): Enhance insight engine with protective factors

- Upgraded the `churn_analyzer.py` to be more comprehensive and intelligent.
- The engine now includes logic to identify and report on "protective factors," where a feature's value positively contributes to a customer's loyalty.
- Added more insight rules to cover a wider range of churn drivers.
- Increased the number of SHAP drivers used from 3 to 5 across all pipelines for a deeper analysis.
- Fixed a data type bug that caused poor formatting in fallback messages.
