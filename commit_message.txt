refactor(pipeline): Align project with advisory philosophy

- Fully refactored the project to align with the "advise, don't prescribe" philosophy.
- Deleted the obsolete `retention_strategy.py` script.
- Refactored `prediction_pipeline.py` to remove calls to the deleted script, simplifying its purpose.
- Renamed `survival_retention_strategy.py` to `survival_risk_analyzer.py`.
- Modified the new analyzer to output a clean, categorical `TimeBasedRisk` tier (e.g., "Urgent") instead of prescriptive sentences.
- Updated the master pipeline and churn analyzer to use this new, cleaner input.
- This change makes the entire project more consistent, robust, and professional.
