feat: Add SHAP summary plot to dashboard

- Implemented a SHAP summary plot in the Streamlit dashboard.
- The plot is displayed after a batch prediction analysis, showing the overall feature importance for the uploaded dataset.
- Modified the prediction pipeline to save the necessary SHAP values and prepared data for the plot.
- Updated the dashboard to load these files and generate the plot using matplotlib.
- Fixed a bug in the dashboard where the real-time prediction form was broken.
- Updated README.md, devReadme.md, and activity_log.md to reflect these changes.
