refactor(analyzer): Implement context-aware insight engine

- Refactored the `churn_analyzer.py` module to be "context-aware."
- The insight generation logic now validates SHAP drivers against the customer's actual data, ensuring all insights are factually correct.
- This new engine can correctly identify both risk factors (e.g., having a month-to-month contract) and protective factors (e.g., having tech support when other risks are high).
- This change dramatically improves the accuracy, intelligence, and professional quality of the final Churn Risk Profile.
